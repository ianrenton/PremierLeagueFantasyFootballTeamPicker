Premier League Fantasy Football Team Picker
===========================================

This script picks the optimum team for the Premier League's Fantasy Football game, combining player stats with online injury lists. Useful so that people like me, who know nothing about football, have a chance! Note that it is only as good as the data it has access to, so it's probably a bad idea to change your team according to its suggestions within the first few weeks of the season - wait until it has more data before trusting it.

THIS SCRIPT IS NO LONGER WORKING.
Since the 2011-2012 season, the Premier League Fantasy Football website has been changed to allow no access to the game stats without being logged in.  This team picker will be offline until I find a work-around for this.
